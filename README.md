# CS5478-Project
Grasping objects is a classic problem in the field of robotic control, involving critical challenges such as motion planning and grasp position prediction. Motion planning ensures that the robot navigates without colliding with obstacles, while grasp position prediction enables the robot to identify the most optimal position for grasping objects. In this project, we have constructed a simulated environment using PyBullet to compare various motion planning algorithms. Additionally, we employed the GQ-CNN neural network for precise grasp position prediction. A range of metrics has been designed for a comprehensive evaluation of these algorithms. Our study not only addresses key challenges in robotic control but also contributes to the advancement of robotic manipulation techniques in practical applications.
